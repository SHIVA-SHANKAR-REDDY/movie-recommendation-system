This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning algorithms. It leverages Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, and deploys the model on AWS using S3 for data storage.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning.
- Model deployment on AWS S3.
- Recommendation generation for users.
